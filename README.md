# ESP32 Bluetooth SHT40 Sensor with LED Indicators

This project uses an **ESP32** to read temperature and humidity data from an **SHT40 sensor**, and transmit it over **Bluetooth SPP (Serial Port Profile)** to a paired device (e.g., Android). It also includes **on-board LED indications** for Bluetooth states and data transmission.

## üöÄ Features

- üì° **Bluetooth SPP Server**  
  ESP32 runs as a Bluetooth Classic SPP server named `esp32_bt_temp`.

- üå°Ô∏è **Temperature & Humidity Sensing**  
  Reads data from the SHT40 sensor via I2C.

- üí° **LED Indications**  
  On-board LED (GPIO 2) shows Bluetooth status and activity:

  | Event                           | LED Pattern                                |
  |--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
  | Bluetooth Initialized          | 10 short blinks                             |
  | Bluetooth Device Connected     | 5 short blinks                              |
  | Bluetooth Device Disconnected | 1 long pulse + 4 quick flickers             |
  | Data Transmitted via Bluetooth | 2 short blinks                              |
